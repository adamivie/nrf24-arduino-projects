✅ Chip Connection: CONNECTED
❌ Communication Test: FAILED

**Wiring:** Standard configuration (CE=7, CSN=8)
```

## 💡 Feature Requests

### What Makes a Good Feature Request

- **Clear use case:** Explain why this would be useful
- **Detailed description:** What should it do exactly?
- **Implementation ideas:** Any thoughts on how to build it?
- **Backward compatibility:** Won't break existing code

### Feature Request Template

```markdown
**Feature Description:**
Brief summary of the new feature

**Use Case:**
Why would this be useful? What problem does it solve?

**Proposed Implementation:**
Any ideas on how to implement this?

**Additional Context:**
Screenshots, diagrams, or examples that help explain
```

## 🔧 Code Contributions

### Coding Standards

**General Guidelines:**
- Use clear, descriptive variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow Arduino naming conventions
- Keep functions focused and small

**Code Style:**
```cpp
// Use camelCase for variables and functions
int messageCounter = 0;
bool isConnected = false;

// Use UPPER_CASE for constants
#define MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH 64
const int DEFAULT_CHANNEL = 76;

// Indent with 2 spaces
void sendMessage() {
  if (radio.isConnected()) {
    // Function body
  }
}

// Comment complex sections
// Calculate packet loss percentage based on expected vs received
float lossRate = ((float)packetsLost / (float)totalPackets) * 100.0;
```

### Submission Process

1. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/awesome-new-feature
   ```

2. **Make your changes:**
   - Write clean, documented code
   - Test thoroughly on real hardware
   - Update documentation if needed

3. **Commit your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add awesome new feature
   
   - Implements wireless mesh networking
   - Adds automatic node discovery
   - Includes comprehensive error handling"
   ```

4. **Push and create PR:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/awesome-new-feature
   ```
   Then create a Pull Request on GitHub.

### Testing Requirements

**Before submitting:**
- ✅ Code compiles without warnings
- ✅ Tested on real hardware (not just simulation)
- ✅ Existing examples still work
- ✅ New features have example code
- ✅ Documentation updated

**Testing Checklist:**
```
□ Basic compilation test
□ Hardware communication test  
□ Range/reliability test
□ Different Arduino models (if available)
□ Different NRF24L01 modules
□ Various pin configurations
```
